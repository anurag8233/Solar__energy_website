                <h3>Solar Panels Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Charles Fritts created the first commercial solar panel, which was reported by Fritts as continuous,
                    constant and of considerable force not only by exposure to sunlight, but also to dim daylight.
                    However,
                    these solar panels were very inefficient, especially compared to coal-fired power plants. In 1939,
                    Russell Ohl created the solar cell design that is used in many modern solar panels. This design was
                    first used to create the first commercially viable silicon solar cell. After that the process of
                    silicon
                    surface passivation by thermal oxidation was developed. The surface passivation process has since
                    been
                    critical to solar cell efficiency.

                <h3>Charge Controller</h3>
                <p>
                    A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current
                    is
                    added to or drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against
                    overvoltage,
                    which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent
                    completely draining a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery
                    technology, to
                    protect battery life. The name "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a
                    stand-alone device, or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered
                    device, or
                    battery charger.

                <h3>Battery System</h3>
                <p>
                    A home battery system stores surplus solar power for later use. The solar battery extends the use of
                    a
                    PV-system’s generated energy and will provide free, sustainable power even when the sun is not
                    shining
                    and the panels don’t produce energy.
                    Therefore, with a solar battery little to no electricity is fed into the grid while also avoiding
                    having
                    to buy expensive electricity from the grid later. Due to the increased self-consumption, the
                    electricity
                    costs decrease significantly.
                    With a battery system the excess solar power produced during the day can be used when it is actually
                    needed.

                <h3>Direct Current Power</h3>
                <p>
                    Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An
                    electrochemical
                    cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but
                    can
                    also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams.
                    The
                    electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current.
                    Direct current may be converted from an alternating current supply by use of a rectifier which
                    allows
                    current to flow only in one direction. Direct current may be converted into alternating current via
                    an
                    inverter.

                <h3>Solar Inverter</h3>
                <p>
                    A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable
                    direct
                    current output of a photovoltaic solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current that can
                    be
                    fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a
                    critical
                    balance of system (BOS)–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered
                    equipment. Solar power inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays,
                    including maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection.

                <h3>Alternating Current Power</h3>
                <p>
                    Instantaneous power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the
                    circuit. In alternating current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors
                    may
                    result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.
                    The portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the AC waveform, results in net
                    transfer of
                    energy in one direction is known as active power. The portion of power due to stored energy, which
                    eturns to the source in each cycle, is known as instantaneous reactive power, and its amplitude is
                    the
                    absolute value of reactive power.
